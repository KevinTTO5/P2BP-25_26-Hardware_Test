"""Bundled-asset locator + subprocess runner.

Implements doc `installer/plan/00-FRAMEWORK-AND-BOOTSTRAP.md` §4.2:
PyInstaller `--onefile` unpacks bundled data files into a temp dir exposed
as `sys._MEIPASS` at runtime ("frozen" mode). When running from a plain
source checkout ("dev mode") there is no `sys._MEIPASS`, so assets are
resolved relative to this file's own directory instead.

Framework-only module: no step1-7 business logic lives here, and this
module deliberately does NOT import `privilege.py` (§9). `run_bundled_script`
instead accepts an already-prepared `env` mapping as a plain parameter; the
caller is responsible for building that environment and passing it in.

Public API:
    asset_path(*parts)                 -- locate a bundled asset.
    stage_assets(*parts, prefix=...)   -- copy a bundled asset *directory*
        out to a fresh staging dir, preserving its layout.
    run_streamed(command, renderer=, stream=, verbose=, ...)
                                       -- run a child and stream, capture and
        redact its output in one pass (doc 08 section 4.2).
    run_bundled_script(*asset_parts, args=, env=, tree=, inherit_env=,
                       cleanup=)       -- stage and execute a fragment.

Four properties this module owes its callers:

1. **Tree staging.** A bundled bash fragment that does
   `source "$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/common.sh"` only works if the whole directory
   lands together, so `stage_assets` copies a directory rather than a single
   file and `run_bundled_script(..., tree=(...))` runs the fragment from
   inside that staged tree.
2. **Environment merging.** `env` is an *overlay* on `os.environ` by default
   (`inherit_env=True`). Replacing the environment outright strips `PATH`,
   which breaks every `command -v` in the staged bash; pass
   `inherit_env=False` for the hermetic replace semantics.
3. **Transcript capture (§8.2).** The command line, any explicit environment
   overrides, and both output streams of every shelled-out fragment go to
   `logs.log` -- stdout at info level, stderr at warn level.
4. **One pass over the output (doc 08 §4.2).** `run_streamed` is the single
   place a child's output is read: it fills the `CompletedProcess` buffers
   and writes each line out as it arrives, so live output and captured
   output can never disagree and no stream is read twice.
   `run_bundled_script` runs through it rather than keeping a second
   subprocess path of its own. **Exactly one writer** touches the terminal
   for a given line -- the renderer when there is one, `logs.log` when there
   is not, nobody under `stream=False` -- because a second raw write to the
   same stream duplicates the line and tears through the live region's
   cursor arithmetic. Control characters are stripped with
   `progress.sanitise` and nothing else: this module deliberately keeps no
   stripper of its own, so there is one definition of "clean" rather than
   two that agree today and drift later.

Exactly what redaction guarantees, stated precisely because the transcript
is an audited artifact:

- **By value.** Every value the child environment carries under a
  `_REDACT_KEYS` name is scrubbed wherever it appears in the command line,
  the environment dump, or either output stream, prefix or no prefix. This
  is what covers `set -x` tracing, `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer
  $NGC_API_KEY"`, and a tool echoing an argument back in an error message.
  Value scrubbing is exact-substring, so a fragment that transforms a secret
  before printing it (base64, URL-encoding, splitting it across lines)
  defeats it.
- **By key.** Any `KEY=` occurrence for a `_REDACT_KEYS` name additionally
  blanks the rest of that line, which catches a secret this process never
  held -- one the fragment read from a file or generated itself.
- **Not covered.** A secret under a key not in `_REDACT_KEYS`, and an empty
  or whitespace-only value (scrubbing those would match everywhere).

Both rules apply to streamed output before it is written anywhere a person
reads it. Showing a command live must not be how a secret becomes visible
that captured output would have hidden (doc 08 §4.2). The returned buffer is
the deliberate exception: §4.2 names the terminal and the transcript, the
buffer has never been redacted, and scrubbing it corrupts what its callers
parse -- an inherited `NGC_API_KEY=abc` turns a child's `version abc123
build` into `version <redacted>123 build`. `run_streamed(redact_capture=True)`
opts a caller in where that trade is worth making.

    written out once. The return value is a `CompletedProcess` populated as
    `subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True, text=True)` populates it, which
    is what lets `Context.run_root` adopt this without any of its 72 call
    sites changing.

    **Exactly one writer for the child's output.** A line is written by
    whoever owns the terminal, and by nobody else:

    - a live renderer, when one is supplied (or when `verbose` asks for the
      fallback). The renderer draws; `logs` is not called, because a second
      raw `print` to the same stream both duplicates the line and tears
      through the cursor arithmetic the live region is redrawn with.
    - `logs.log`, when nothing is streaming but suppression was not asked
      for. That is stderr plus the transcript, exactly what this module did
      before streaming existed, so `run_bundled_script` keeps the behaviour
      it has always had.
    - nobody, under `stream=False`. The escape hatch for a probe whose
      output would be noise: it is captured and returned, and that is all.

    Known gap, to close with U12 (doc 08 §7.1): a streamed line does not
    reach the transcript, because `logs` has no transcript-only sink yet and
    its one writer also prints to stderr. U12 adds that sink; the fix here is
    the two `_record` calls below. No call site streams with a renderer until
    U4, so nothing regresses in the meantime.

    **Redaction comes first.** Each line is scrubbed by value and by key (see
    the module docstring) before it reaches the terminal or the transcript.
    A secret must not become visible merely because output is now shown live.
    The returned buffer is deliberately *not* scrubbed by default: §4.2 names
    the terminal and the transcript, the buffer has never been redacted, and
    scrubbing it silently corrupts what 72 call sites parse -- an inherited
    `NGC_API_KEY=abc` would turn a child's `version abc123 build` into
    `version <redacted>123 build`. Pass `redact_capture=True` for a caller
    that would rather lose fidelity than hold the plaintext.

    `secrets=None` derives the secret values from the child's own environment
    (or from this process's, when the child inherits it), so an inherited
    `NGC_API_KEY` is covered without the caller having to say so.

    `check`, `timeout` and `input` behave as they do on `subprocess.run`,
    including raising `CalledProcessError` and `TimeoutExpired` carrying the
    output collected so far. `stdout=` and `stderr=` are rejected, since the
    runner owns both pipes; `capture_output`, `text` and `universal_newlines`
    are accepted and ignored, since both are implied. Every other keyword
    goes through to `Popen`.

    **Undecodable output is replaced, not fatal** -- the one deliberate
    divergence from `subprocess.run`, which raises `UnicodeDecodeError` and
    hands back nothing at all. `apt` and `dpkg` emit non-UTF-8 bytes in
    package descriptions and maintainer names as a matter of routine, and
    killing a half-finished install over a byte in a description is the
    failure doc 08 §2 exists to prevent. Parity is unaffected for every run
    that returns: this only differs where `subprocess.run` would have raised
    instead of returning. Pass `errors="strict"` to get that behaviour back.

    ``asset_parts`` names the fragment relative to the assets root.

    ``tree`` names an ancestor directory of the fragment, also relative to
    the assets root; when given, that whole directory is staged with
    ``stage_assets`` and the fragment runs from inside the staged copy, with
    ``cwd`` set to the staged copy of ``tree``. ``asset_parts`` must start
    with ``tree``. Use ``tree=()`` to stage the entire ``assets/`` tree --
    the mode a fragment needs if it reads a sibling subtree, since a partial
    stage copies only the subtree named. ``tree=None`` (the default) keeps
    the original single-file copy behaviour.

    ``MV3DT_ASSET_ROOT`` is exported to the child whenever a tree is staged,
    and always means **the root of the staged assets tree**, whichever
    subtree was staged. So ``$MV3DT_ASSET_ROOT/scripts/lib/common.sh`` is the
    correct spelling under both ``tree=("scripts",)`` and ``tree=()``; what
    differs between them is only what else exists beside ``scripts/``. A
    value for it supplied in ``env`` is ignored, with a warning -- the real
    staging path is the only correct answer, and a stale one sends the
    fragment somewhere that no longer exists.

    ``env`` is an already-prepared environment mapping (e.g. produced by
    ``privilege.py``, §9). By default (``inherit_env=True``) it is merged
    *over* ``os.environ`` rather than replacing it -- replacing outright
    strips ``PATH`` and breaks every ``command -v`` in the staged bash.
    ``inherit_env=False`` gives the hermetic replace semantics, in which
    case ``env`` (plus ``MV3DT_ASSET_ROOT`` when a tree is staged) is the
    complete child environment.

    ``cleanup=True`` (the default) removes the staging directory in a
    ``finally``. Pass ``cleanup=False`` to leave it in place for post-run
    debugging of the executed fragment.

    ``renderer``, ``stream`` and ``verbose`` are handed straight to
    ``run_streamed``, which is what actually executes the fragment. With no
    ``renderer`` -- the default, since ``run_bundled_script`` has no
    ``Context`` and so no progress handle of its own to reach for -- the
    fragment's output is written by ``logs.log`` exactly as it always was.
    Passing a ``renderer`` moves that job to it, and ``stream=False`` drops
    the fragment's output from the transcript along with the terminal, so
    reserve it for a probe whose output is noise.

    **One behaviour did change with streaming**: the fragment's output lines
    now reach the transcript interleaved, in the order the fragment actually
    produced them, where they used to be all of stdout followed by all of
    stderr. Arrival order is the more faithful record -- it shows which
    warning belongs to which step of the fragment -- and reconstructing the
    old grouping would mean buffering the whole run, which is the thing
    streaming exists to stop doing.

    The command line, the explicit environment overrides, and both output
    streams are written to the transcript per §8.2. Secrets are scrubbed by
    value and by key with the guarantees and limits spelled out in this
    module's docstring; note that transformed output (a base64-encoded key,
    say) is beyond any scrubber's reach. The ``CompletedProcess`` returned
    to the caller is unredacted, since callers parse it.
