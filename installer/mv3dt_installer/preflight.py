"""Platform and invoking-user preflight for mv3dt-installer (doc 00 §5.1.1).

Mirrors the *behavior* of installer/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh's
`preflight_os_arch()` and `preflight_root_and_user()`, re-expressed in
Python. Nothing here sources or executes that script — this module is a
self-contained sibling of it, the same discipline logs.py, privilege.py and
report.py already follow with laptop/scripts/lib/common.sh.

These two gates exist because the installer binary is downloaded and run
directly on a bare workstation: nothing upstream of it validates the
platform, and nothing else notices when there is no real invoking user to
own the secrets, the NGC config, and the AutoMagicCalib clone.

Public API:
    read_os_release(path=Path("/etc/os-release")) -> dict[str, str]
        -- parse the shell-style key=value file into a plain dict.
    require_supported_platform(*, os_release_path=..., machine=platform.machine)
        -- exit (via logs.die) unless the host is Ubuntu 24.04 on x86_64.
    require_invoking_user() -> privilege.InvokingUser
        -- resolve the invoking user, refusing to proceed as bare root.

Why /etc/os-release and not `lsb_release`:
    `lsb_release` is not installed by default on a minimal Ubuntu 24.04
    image, which is exactly why bootstrap.sh had to degrade its distro check
    to a warning ("lsb_release not found; cannot verify Ubuntu 24.04 —
    proceeding"). /etc/os-release is part of systemd and is always present,
    so the check can be a real gate here instead of an advisory one.
    Its `ID` field is lowercase ("ubuntu") where `lsb_release -is` reports
    "Ubuntu", so the distro comparison is case-insensitive.

Escape hatch (development only):
    Setting MV3DT_SKIP_PLATFORM_CHECK=1 downgrades every platform failure —
    including an unreadable /etc/os-release — from a fatal error to a
    warning, so the binary can be exercised on a developer machine that is
    not an Ubuntu 24.04 workstation. It is deliberately undocumented for
    operators: an install performed with it set is unsupported, since every
    pinned version in the step specs assumes Ubuntu 24.04 / x86_64.
