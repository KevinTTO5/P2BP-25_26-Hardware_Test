"""systemd unit rendering, idempotent install, and lifecycle helpers.

Framework-only module. It owns the mechanical half of locked decision 3(b) of
the release-model plan -- after the first calibration, later recalibrations are
ingested automatically, with no installer run and no operator command -- plus
the shared unit-install helper
[`STEP-6-REMOTE-SUPERVISION.md`](../plan/STEP-6-REMOTE-SUPERVISION.md)
section A.4 needs (copy units, `daemon-reload`, `enable`).

Templates live under `assets/systemd/` and are resolved through
`shellout.asset_path`, so they work identically from a source checkout and from
the frozen PyInstaller binary. They use at-sign-delimited markers such as
`@EXPORT_DIR@` rather than a systemd template unit with `%i`: the watched
export directory is an arbitrary absolute path under the invoking user's home,
and instance-name path escaping is exactly the cleverness STEP-6 section B.1
already weighed and rejected once.

Two rules this module enforces rather than documents:

* `render_unit` raises if any marker survives substitution. A half-rendered
  unit file is worse than a missing one -- systemd would accept it and then
  behave in a way nobody wrote down.
* `enable_now` refuses when the unit's `ExecStart` binary is absent. The ingest
  units point at `<install_dir>/bin/mv3dt-installer`, which STEP-3 creates and
  STEP-3 is unimplemented, so a unit enabled today would fail on every single
  trigger. Refusing loudly is correct until that lands.

**Only the `.path` unit is ever enabled.** Its paired `.service` is
`Type=oneshot` and is owned by the path unit's lifecycle; enabling both makes
the boot-time state race the path trigger (STEP-6 section A.4's lesson, and the
carve-out spelled out in section B.1).

Every `systemctl` invocation goes through an injected `runner`, defaulting to
`subprocess.run`, so tests never touch real systemd. The runner is called with
a single argv **list**, matching `subprocess.run`'s own signature. A production
caller holding an `app.Context` passes `ctx.run_root`, which takes its argv as
varargs, so it needs a one-line adapter::

    runner=lambda argv, **kwargs: ctx.run_root(*argv, **kwargs)

Nothing here writes to `/etc/systemd/system` unless a caller asks for the
default `unit_dir`, and no function in this module chowns anything: the
installer is already root by the time any step runs (`privilege.require_root`
gates `main()`), so files it creates are root-owned by construction.

    ``template_parts`` are path components under the bundled ``assets/``
    directory, resolved with `shellout.asset_path` -- e.g.
    ``("systemd", "mv3dt-ingest.path.in")``.

    ``substitutions`` maps **bare** marker names to their values: the key
    ``"EXPORT_DIR"`` replaces every occurrence of ``@EXPORT_DIR@``. Values are
    substituted literally, with no shell or systemd escaping applied.

    Because substitution is literal, **quoting is the template's job and the
    templates do it**: any marker landing inside a word-split directive such as
    `ExecStart=` is written double-quoted in the `.in` file, so a value
    containing whitespace survives. Callers rendering their own templates owe
    the same. What literal substitution cannot express is a value containing a
    double quote, a backslash, or a newline -- those would break out of the
    quoting or out of the directive entirely, so `render_ingest_units` rejects
    them up front rather than emitting a unit that misbehaves.

    Raises `ValueError` if any marker survives substitution, naming the ones
    that were left behind. A partially rendered unit is worse than no unit at

    ``project`` is free-form operator text typed into the AMC GUI

    is escaped to `%%` for the same reason: every directive these markers land
