"""Shared logger and transcript writer for mv3dt-installer (doc 00 §8.1-8.2).

Mirrors the *behavior* of laptop/scripts/lib/common.sh's log_info/log_warn/
log_error/die: colour-aware, level-prefixed lines to stderr, so stdout stays
reserved for machine-parsable output. Every emitted line is also appended to
the transcript log file once one is open (see open_transcript()).

This module is a self-contained sibling of laptop/ (doc 00 §3.1) — it does
not import or source anything under laptop/scripts/lib/common.sh or any
other laptop/ path.

Public API:
    log.info(msg)      -- level "info", coloured green when stderr is a tty.
    log.warn(msg)       -- level "warn", coloured yellow when stderr is a tty.
    log.error(msg)      -- level "error", coloured red when stderr is a tty.
    transcript(level, msg) -- append one line to the transcript *only*,
        printing nothing (doc 08 §7.1).
    die(msg)             -- log.error(msg) then sys.exit(1); never returns.
    set_colour(enabled)  -- the authoritative colour decision, or None to
        go back to the pre-parse default (doc 08 §7).
    set_live_writer(stream, writer) / clear_live_writer(writer) -- hand the
        printed copy of a log line to a live renderer that owns the cursor
        on `stream`, so a log call cannot corrupt its redraw arithmetic
        (doc 08 §12.2 defect 3). `writer(level, line)`.
    open_transcript(log_dir=None) -- open/create the per-run transcript file
        and wire subsequent log.*() calls to also append to it. Returns the
        path to the per-run file.

Secrets redaction is owned by other modules (ngc.py, webapp.py per doc 00
§10/§14.4) — callers must pass already-redacted strings; this module does no
redaction of its own.

# sites pass raw command output straight into log.info), and doc 00 §8.2
# admits none of them whatever wrote them.

# Two passes, because an escape sequence is a run of printable characters

#
# _ESCAPE_RE  CSI, OSC and the two-character forms, introduced by ESC.
# _CONTROL_RE every remaining control character, which is what catches a

#             decode of a latin-1 stream produces, BEL, backspace, NUL and
#             DEL. TAB and LF survive deliberately: a log message is allowed
#             to be indented and to span lines, and the transcript is a file
#             rather than a redrawn region.
#
# This is `progress.sanitise` minus the whitespace handling that a single

# into a run that forbids it. It is not authoritative, because argv is not
# where the answer lives once the arguments are parsed -- `set_colour` is,
# and the unit that owns `app.py` calls it with the parsed value.
#
# Conservative means every spelling argparse accepts. `build_parser()`
# takes argparse's defaults, so `allow_abbrev` is on and any unambiguous
# prefix parses: `--non` and `--non-int` are the flag today. `store_true`
# rejects `--non-interactive=x`, so that form is unreachable, but the split

    is then short by exactly that many rows and the clear-below eats real

    log calls, so this is not a corner case.

    into it. The level is passed because it decides what the region does

    is written and the region is left down rather than redrawn beneath it.
