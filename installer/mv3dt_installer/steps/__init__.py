"""Step-module interface and registry.

Implements doc `00-FRAMEWORK-AND-BOOTSTRAP.md` §12.1 (the `Step` protocol)
and §12.2 (`StepStatus`, `StepResult`, and the `UserAction` type referenced
from §9.3). This module is framework-only: it defines the contract that
`stepN_*.py` modules (step1_prerequisites.py … step5_per_project_exes.py)
implement and register against. No step business logic lives here.

The optional `phases` declaration and its accessors implement doc
`08-PROGRESS-AND-OBSERVABILITY.md` §3.1 and §9. They are declarative only:
nothing here influences how a step's `run()` executes.

`Context` (§12.3) is built later in `app.py`, which depends on nearly every
other module in this package and is therefore integrated last. To avoid a
circular/premature import, this module uses `from __future__ import
annotations` (PEP 563) so `Context` can appear as an unevaluated type hint
in the `Step` protocol's method signatures without being imported or
stubbed here.
